## 📌 Introduction

A fictional real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to create a Machine Learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium. Herein, a dataset would need to be created to gather information about at least 10.000 properties all over Belgium. This dataset will later be used as a training set for the prediction model.
